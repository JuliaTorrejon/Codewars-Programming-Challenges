def even_or_odd(number):
  return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'
  
# Notes: The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. An expression like x % y evaluates to the remainder of x รท y. Precedence is the same as operators / (division) and * (multiplication).

>>> 9 / 2
4
>>> 9 % 2
1
9 divided by 2 is equal to 4.
4 times 2 is 8
9 minus 8 is 1 - the remainder.
